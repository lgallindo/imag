## libimagflashcard

Flash card program.

Asks the user a question and uses heuristics to check whether the answer is
correct (string matching).

Each flashcard is one imag entry. Entries can be grouped together (imag
links). A flashcard can be in several groups.
The Sessions-Feature can be used to track progress and add a value to each
flashcard, so when starting a new learning session, better learned cards show
up less often.
